>📋  A template README.md for code accompanying a Machine Learning paper

# My Paper Title

This repository is the official implementation of [My Paper Title](https://arxiv.org/abs/2030.12345). 

>📋  Optional: include a graphic explaining your approach/main result, bibtex entry, link to demos, blog posts and tutorials

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

>📋  Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...

## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --input-data <path_to_data> --alpha 10 --beta 20
```

>📋  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python eval.py --model-file mymodel.pth --benchmark imagenet
```

>📋  Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).

## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ImageNet using parameters x,y,z. 

>📋  Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

### [Image Classification on ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet)

| Model name         | Top 1 Accuracy  | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model   |     85%         |      95%       |

>📋  Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it. 


## Contributing

>📋  Pick a licence and describe how to contribute to your code repository. 


## Docker reproducibility management

Directories `configs`, `scripts`, `src` are mounted in the Docker image, and should contain all code for readers to reproduce our results: main program contained in `src`, experiment settings contained in `configs`, and `scripts` that run experiments using `config` and `src`.

Local directories `cache`, `data`, `work` are for managing your work. These are in `gitignore` and are not commited. 

`snellius_env` is for us to keep track of our job files.

### Example workflow

#### Local development workflow

Since `src`, `scripts`, and `configs` directories are mounted in real-time from your local machine, changes to your code appear immediately inside the containear.

  1. Modify code or script.
  2. Ensure Docker Desktop is set to Linux container mode on Windows (or simply use Docker on macOS).
  3. Pull the latest image from Docker Hub: `docker pull lesterpjy10/refact-multiarch:latest`
  4. Set test/run alias (Remove `--gpus all` for local without gpu) 
     ```
     alias dtest="docker run --rm -it \
	 -v $(pwd)/data:/local/data \
	 -v $(pwd)/cache:/local/cache \
	 -v $(pwd)/work:/local/work \
	 -v $(pwd)/src:/local/src \
	 -v $(pwd)/scripts:/local/scripts \
	 -v $(pwd)/configs:/local/configs \
	 --gpus all"
  5. Run an interactive test: `dtest lesterpjy10/refact-multiarch:latest bash`
  6. Or, for environment sanity check, run `dtest lesterpjy10/refact-multiarch python scripts/test_env.py` 
 
#### Committing and tagging for release

  1. Once you are satisfied with local testing, **add-commit-push** to your branch (this does not build the image)
  2. To release an image:
     ```
     git tag build-* 
     git push origin build-*
     ```
     replace `*` with an unique name. Alternatively, builds could be triggered in the Github action UI for the default branch.
  3. Github Action will spin up, build linux/amd64 + linux/arm64 images, and push them to Docker Hub as:
     ```
     lesterpjy10/refact-multiarch:latest
     lesterpjy10/refact-multiarch:build-*
     ```

#### Test and run image on Snellius

  1. Pull your changes on Snellius
  2. Edit user name in job file `snellius_env/dockerim2sif.job` Replace `/tmp/scur2818XXXX` for `APPTAINER_TMPDIR` with your own user name, if your SURF username is `user01`, change to `/tmp/user01XXXX`
  3. Run `sbatch snellius_env/dockerim2sif.job` to pull Docker image from Dockerhub, and convert image to sif file for Apptainer.
  4. Check sif file successfully built by inspecting output file `work/build_container_*.out`
  5. Run `sbatch snellius_env/test_env.job` to test container environment with `Apptainer run`
  6. Check package successfully installed by inspecting the output file under `work` directory.
  7. `test_env.py` output should look like:
